## TRICKS & SECRETS

### Hidden Mechanics & Workarounds

**Ring of Regeneration Stacking**
- You can wear **multiple Rings of Regeneration** at once!
- Each ring heals 50 HP per turn in combat
- 2 rings = 100 HP/turn, 3 rings = 150 HP/turn, etc.
- **Caveat:** To swap rings, you must **remove them first**
- Removed rings go back to inventory and can be re-equipped or sold

**Fountain Usage**
- **DON'T say "drink fountain"** - this uses your health potions by mistake!
- **DO say "swim in fountain"** or just **"fountain"** instead
- Fountains fully restore health AND mana (one use per fountain)

**Equipment Command Workaround**
- If the game won't recognize an item name, try saying **"hidden"** before it
- Example: "equip hidden mystic staff" or "wear hidden ancient ring"
- This helps with items that have complex names

**Time Stop Secret**
- The description says 2 turns, but Time Stop actually gives you **3 full turns**!
- Use all 3 turns to unleash devastating combos
- Perfect for taking down high-HP bosses

**Meditate Frequently**
- Meditation restores mana **outside of combat** for free
- Scales with dungeon level (more mana restored on deeper levels)
- There's **no cooldown** - meditate as much as you want!
- Always meditate before opening chests or entering unexplored rooms

**Save Scumming Strategy**
- Save your game **before fighting a boss**
- If you die, reload and try a different strategy
- Save after finding rare equipment
- Save before opening chests (in case of mimics!)

**Junk Management Pro Tip**
- Mark **all treasures as junk** immediately when found
- They're only valuable for selling (60% of listed value)
- Keep your inventory clean for combat items
- Sell in bulk at merchants for big gold payouts

**Combat Exploit: Sneak Attacks**
- Abilities with "sneak" type (Shadow Strike, Assassinate, Soul Reaper) **skip enemy turn**
- You attack, enemy can't counter, you get another turn!
- Chain sneak attacks for massive damage with no retaliation

**Bracelet Efficiency**
- Bracelets give **both attack AND mana** bonuses
- Two bracelets can give +300 attack and +480 mana at high levels
- More cost-effective than rings for offense
- Prioritize bracelets over rings if you have limited gold

**Merchant Timing**
- Better items unlock at higher **dungeon levels**, not player levels
- Check merchants every 5 dungeon levels for new stock
- Godly-tier items appear at dungeon level 30+
- Stock up on Supreme/Ultimate potions before deep dives

**Secret Room Hunting**
- 30% chance each dungeon level has a hidden passage
- Found by **searching rooms** thoroughly
- Contains bonus rings, potions, amulets, and gold
- Once found, the secret room is revealed permanently for that level

**Equipment Scaling**
- All equipment scales with **dungeon level**, not player level
- Rush deeper for better base stats on equipment
- A level 5 player on dungeon 20 finds better gear than a level 20 player on dungeon 5!

**Death Prevention**
- Elixir of Immortality **auto-revives** you once at 50% health
- Doesn't consume a turn - you keep fighting!
- Stock multiple elixirs for deep dungeon runs
- Buy from merchants at higher dungeon levels

**Spell Cost Reduction**
- Elixir of Clarity reduces spell costs by 50% for 3 battles
- Mage helmets/weapons boost max mana
- More max mana = more spells per fight
- Stack mana equipment for ultimate spell-slinging

**Two-Enemy Fights**
- Appearing more frequently on dungeon level 3+
- AOE spells hit **both enemies** for full damage
- Defeating both gives **double experience**
- Time Stop freezes both enemies for 3 turns each

**Boss Location**
- Boss is **always** in the southeast corner (bottom-right)
- From entrance, go: east, east, east, east, east, south, south, south, south, south
- Stairs appear one room west of the boss
- Clear a path to the boss, then backtrack to explore

**Class-Specific Secrets**

*Warrior:*
- Shield Bash damage scales with shield defense × 3
- Titan Shield + Shield Bash = 300+ damage!
- Stack defense for offense

*Mage:*
- Cosmic Devastation at level 10 can one-shot most bosses
- Mana scaling makes late-game mages unstoppable
