Echo Dungeon: Version 11 — The Infinite Odyssey
​Overview
​Welcome to Echo Dungeon Eleven. This is an infinite, voice-controlled RPG designed for total darkness. There is no visual interface and no text display. The entire screen is a single tactile button. Tap once to speak; the dungeon will respond with sound and voice.
​New Mastery: The Arch-Mage
​Since you have achieved mastery over the arcane, the dungeon now recognizes you as an Arch-Mage.
​Arcane Overflow: Your spells now deal 1% extra damage for every 10 points of Max Mana you possess. With 3,000 Mana, you are significantly more powerful than a standard mage.
​Mana Shield: You can now use your vast mana pool as armor. Say "Activate Mana Shield" to absorb 50% of incoming damage using your mana instead of your health.
​Spell Echo: Your mastery allows your spells to occasionally echo. There is a 20% chance any spell you cast will hit the enemy a second time for free.
​Vital Commands
​You can speak these commands at any time after tapping the screen:
​"Status Report" or "Eyes of the Mind": The dungeon will read your health, mana, gold, and current floor level.
​"Sense Mana": Feel the room for hidden treasures or the power levels of nearby enemies.
​"Inventory": Hear a list of your current equipment and potions.
​"Meditate": Rest to recover health. As an Arch-Mage, meditation now restores a large portion of your mana as well.
​The Infinite Descent
​There is no end to this journey.
​Eras: Every 10 floors, the atmosphere of the dungeon shifts—from Stone Crypts to Magma Arteries, and eventually to the Eternal Echo.
​Vaults: Puzzles have been removed. Secret rooms are now massive Treasure Vaults. If you find one, you will receive legendary loot and gold immediately.
​The Statue of the Ancients: If you carry more than 50,000 gold, look for Shrines. You can offer your wealth to the statue to permanently increase your Max Mana.
​Survival & Trade
​Auto-Potion: Simply say "Heal" or "Drink Mana Potion". The game will automatically use the highest-tier potion in your bag (Greater, Supreme, or Ultimate).
​Bulk Buying: When meeting a merchant, you can say "Buy ten Health Potions" to stock up instantly.
​Alchemy: During meditation, you can say "Combine Potions". Three standard potions will merge into one Greater version.
​For the Sovereign
​Every 50 floors, the dungeon will pause to acknowledge your legend. Your name is whispered by the walls, and your power will grow as a tribute to your persistence.
​The descent is yours. Tap the screen to begin.
